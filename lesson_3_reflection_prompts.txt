When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	If more than one person is working on the project, or we are using more than one machine for a project. 
	If we want to share our work with other people. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	In case we are working in a larger teams, and I don't want to implement their code before I finish writing mine. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are copies of repository in Github.
	Clones are local copies of repository stored on Github. 
	Branches are always inside the repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	Easier merging, fewer things can go wrong. It's always good practice to have a copy saved to more than one place.
