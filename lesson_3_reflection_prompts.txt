When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	If more than one person is working on the project, or we are using more than one machine for a project. 
	If we want to share our work with other people. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	In case we are working in a larger teams, and I don't want to implement their code before I finish writing mine.
