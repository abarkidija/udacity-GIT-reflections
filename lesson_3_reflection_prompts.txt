When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	If more than one person is working on the project, or we are using more than one machine for a project. 
	If we want to share our work with other people. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	In case we are working in a larger teams, and I don't want to implement their code before I finish writing mine. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are copies of repository in Github.
	Clones are local copies of repository stored on Github. 
	Branches are always inside the repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	Easier merging, fewer things can go wrong. It's always good practice to have a copy saved to more than one place. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Probably using copy paste a lot, sending files through mail, and than merging manually. 
	Start would be easier (there would be no need to learn how to use Git and Git hub.) later as the project grows it would be harder and harder to merge code. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	If master is in use at the moment, and we don't want to mess with it, we could just make changes in separate branch until we see that everything works. 
	making it directly in master is faster.
